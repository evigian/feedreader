# Feedreader

## Project Overview

This is the 5th project of the Google Front-End Developers Nanodegree at Udacity. It is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and needs the tests via Jasmine framework to be completed (http://jasmine.github.io). The starter code and the first test for this project was provided by Udacity (http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

## How to run the application

Clone or download the repository and open the index file on the browser to see the application along with the results of Jasmine testing.

## Jasmine tests

1. A test within RSS Feeds suite that loops through each feed and ensures that they have a URL defined and this is not empty.
2. A test within RSS Feeds suite that loops through each feed and ensures that they have a name defined and this is not empty.
3. A test suite that ensures that the menu element is hidden by default and the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
4. A test suite that ensures that there is at least a single entry within the feed container when the loadfeed function is called.
5. A test suite that ensures that the content actually changes when a new feed is loaded.
